"**Behler-Parrinello Neural Network (BPNN)** is a type of neural network "
"specifically designed to approximate potential energy surfaces in "
"molecular dynamics simulations :cite:`bpnn, behler2021`."

#: ../../source/bpnn/index.rst:7
msgid ""
"It uses special architecture called **High-Dimensional Neural Network "
"(HDNN)** that contains 2 main parts: 1. **Symmetry Functions** - to "
"encode the local environment of atoms in a system. 2. Subnets - **Atomic "
"Networks (AtomicNN)** - for each sort of atoms (chemical species) in the "
"system."

"The BPNN architecture is a generalization of the Behler-Parrinello "
"approach to neural networks, which allows for the representation of "

"For the BPNN to work, it is necessary to encode the local environment of "
"atoms in a system. This is done using **Atomic-Centered Symmetry "

"ACSFs are designed to be invariant to translations, rotations, and "
"permutations of atoms in the system so it encodes uniquely the local "
"environment of each atom. There are two types of ACSFs: 1. **Radial "
"Functions** - depend only on the distance between atoms."
